Fantasy Games

It is a simple react based site developed by using react, bootstrap, custom CSS, JavaScript and html. For design purpose I have used Font Awesome icons and to maintain operational route I also used react router.

Functionality:
1.	At the home page this site displays a banner on the top and almost 21 leagues of different sports on the bellow.
2.	Each league is displayed on a card that contain league logo, name, sport type and an explore button. After clicking on the button, it will redirect to the League-Details page     that will dynamically change based on league id.
3.	On the details page there is a banner on the top that contains banner and logo of individual league both change dynamically based on clicked league id.
4.	In the middle segment this page contains a card that holds details league data in the left and a dynamic image in the right that changes according to the gender of league  
    beside that the gender icons also changed dynamically based on gander type.
6.	In the bottom of the page there are two segments that describe the league description in both English and French.
7.	At last there is a footer that contain Facebook, Twitter and Instagram icons with link that open the link in new tab if clicked.
8.	And finally, this site is mainly focused react routing, that dynamically changed according to users operate.
